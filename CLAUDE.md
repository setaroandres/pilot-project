# CLAUDE.md

Customer app cloned from the AIDEN starter template. The Upstart13 AI Foundation (AIDEN) ships auth, database, security, logging, AI, and UI as versioned `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` packages — your job is to build features on top of them, not reimplement them.

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript 5 · NextAuth v5 · Prisma 7 + PostgreSQL · `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` packages · shadcn/ui · Tailwind CSS v4 · react-hook-form · Zod

## Verification

After making changes, verify your work:

- `npm run lint` after code changes
- `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm no type errors
- For API routes: `curl` the dev server to confirm response shape
- For UI changes: open the page in a browser and compare against intended design
- `npm run build` only when explicitly requested or before a release

## Where each concern lives

You should rarely touch `src/lib/*.ts` files except to extend them. The heavy lifting lives in `@upstart13-com/aiden-*`.

| Task                              | Use this                                                                                      | Wired in                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Add an API route                  | `withAuth(handler)` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-security`                                      | `src/app/api/.../route.ts`            |
| Validate request body             | `parseRequest(req, zodSchema)` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-security`                           | inside the handler                    |
| Prevent IDOR on user-owned data   | `assertOwnership(row, userId)` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-security`                           | after every fetch                     |
| Get the session                   | `auth()` from `src/lib/auth.ts` (re-exports from `@upstart13-com/aiden-auth`)                 | server components, route handlers     |
| Database access                   | `prisma` from `src/lib/prisma.ts`                                                             | server-side only                      |
| Add a Prisma model                | new fragment under `prisma/fragments/<feature>.prisma`, then `npm run prisma:merge`           |                                       |
| Log something                     | `log.info(...)` from `src/lib/logger.ts` — `requestId`/`userId` auto-attach inside `withAuth` |                                       |
| Call an AI provider               | `createAIClient({ provider, model })` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-ai`                          | wrap in `src/lib/ai.ts`               |
| UI primitives (Button, Card, etc) | `@upstart13-com/aiden-ui` (re-exports themed shadcn)                                          | import directly                       |
| Auth UI                           | `LoginForm` / `RegisterForm` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-auth/components`                      | `src/app/login/`, `src/app/register/` |
| Page layout primitives            | `PageHeader`, `SiteHeader`, `DashboardNav` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-ui`                     | layouts + page headers                |

**Use the `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` packages for these concerns — improve them, don't replace them.** If you find yourself reimplementing one of the above, or reaching for a third-party library to cover auth, security, database, logging, AI, or UI — stop, check the package README, and use the package primitive instead. The `src/lib/*.ts` files are thin wiring shims around the packages (e.g. `src/lib/security.ts` re-exports `@upstart13-com/aiden-security`); extend them, never fork a package's behavior into your app. If a primitive is missing or insufficient, it belongs in the SDK — raise it upstream so the fix ships to every app via `npx aiden upgrade`, rather than building a local or external replacement that drifts from the SDK and breaks on upgrade. (Third-party libraries for genuinely app-specific features the SDK doesn't cover are of course fine.)

---

## IMPORTANT: UI / Frontend Rules

**YOU MUST do ALL THREE of the following before writing ANY UI code — no exceptions:**

1. **Invoke the `frontend-design` skill** — `/frontend-design` with a description of what to build
2. **Read `docs/design-system/00-overview.md`** — always, for every UI task
3. **Read the relevant design system file(s) for the specific component type** (see Pre-Flight table)

This applies to: new pages, component modifications (even small ones), layout changes, forms, modals, cards, tables, icons, navigation — any React/JSX/TSX that renders visible UI.

### Design System Quick Reference

| File                                    | Read when building                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/design-system/00-overview.md`     | **Always** — philosophy, golden rules, anti-patterns |
| `docs/design-system/01-foundations.md`  | Colors, typography, spacing, icons                   |
| `docs/design-system/02-components.md`   | Buttons, cards, badges, dropdowns, tabs              |
| `docs/design-system/03-forms.md`        | Any form, input, select, checkbox, radio             |
| `docs/design-system/04-dialogs.md`      | Any dialog, modal, confirmation, sheet               |
| `docs/design-system/05-data-display.md` | Tables, metric cards, empty states, code blocks      |
| `docs/design-system/06-navigation.md`   | Sidebar, nav items, page headers, breadcrumbs        |
| `docs/design-system/07-feedback.md`     | Loading states, toasts, error states, progress       |
| `docs/design-system/08-page-layouts.md` | New pages, auth pages, settings, detail views        |

### Source of Truth

The canonical design library is **Smithers DS** in Figma — every token, component, and page pattern derives from it 1:1. The implementation is shipped as `@upstart13-com/aiden-ui`. Tokens are loaded from `src/lib/styles.css` which imports `@upstart13-com/aiden-ui/styles/globals.css`.

> **Figma:** [Alacrity / Smithers DS](https://www.figma.com/design/eHCER1DdlXffFVUlU8L3lc/Alacrity?node-id=1813-1074)

Stack: **Inter** (sans) + **JetBrains Mono** (mono). Violet primary (`#7C3AED`) on neutral grays. Full semantic palette (`success`, `warning`, `destructive`, `info`).

### Non-Negotiable UI Rules (the short list — full rules in design system)

- **NEVER hardcode colors.** Always use CSS variable tokens: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `bg-accent`, `text-accent`, `border-border`, etc.
- **Default radius is `rounded-sm` (4px).** Use `rounded-md` (6px) for inputs, `rounded-lg` (8px) for buttons/badges, `rounded-xl` (12px) for cards, `rounded-2xl` (16px) for modals, `rounded-full` only for avatars and dot indicators. Never go above `rounded-2xl`.
- **NEVER use `bg-gray-*`, `text-zinc-*`, `border-slate-*`** — use semantic tokens only.
- **`@upstart13-com/aiden-ui` first.** Use its primitives before reaching for raw shadcn or building custom. If you need a shadcn primitive that isn't re-exported, install it with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` and theme it with our tokens.
- **One primary CTA per page section.** Everything else is `secondary` or `ghost`.
- **Tailwind CSS utility classes only** — no custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- **Responsive design**: mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Every page has a page header** — use `PageHeader` from `@upstart13-com/aiden-ui` (renders `border-b border-border px-6 py-5` — title + optional subtitle + optional action).
- **Lucide icons only** — `import { IconName } from "lucide-react"`, always `strokeWidth={1.5}`, default `size-4`.

---

## Code Style

- Double quotes, not single quotes
- Named exports only — NEVER use default exports (App Router file conventions like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts` are exempt)
- Use `type` imports for type-only imports (`import type { Foo } from "..."`)
- Files: `kebab-case.ts` — Next.js routes follow App Router conventions
- Prefix unused params with `_`
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*` — always use it for internal imports
- Server-only modules (`@prisma/client`, anything from `src/lib/prisma.ts`, `src/lib/auth.ts`) **MUST NOT** be imported in `"use client"` files

---

## Security

Every API route under `src/app/api/**/route.ts` MUST follow this pattern:

```ts
import {
  withAuth,
  parseRequest,
  assertOwnership,
} from "@upstart13-com/aiden-security";
import { z } from "zod";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

const Body = z.object({
  /* ... */
});

export const POST = withAuth(async (req, { session }) => {
  const body = await parseRequest(req, Body);
  const row = await prisma.thing.findUnique({ where: { id: body.id } });
  assertOwnership(row, session.user.id);
  // ... do work ...
  return NextResponse.json({ ok: true });
});
```

Rules:

- Every route MUST call `withAuth` (or `auth()` directly) before any data access — exception: webhooks and explicitly public endpoints
- Every database query on user data MUST scope by `userId` — `assertOwnership` is the IDOR guard
- All request bodies MUST be validated with Zod via `parseRequest` (or `.safeParse()` / `.parse()` directly)
- Never use `$executeRawUnsafe`, `eval()`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or `new Function()`
- Never import server modules in `"use client"` files — leaks secrets to the browser
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or tokens — use environment variables (`aiden doctor` validates these)
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, full API keys) — `log.info()` is fine for everything else; the request context auto-attaches `requestId`/`userId`
- Run `/security-review` before every PR — enforced via `/ship`
- **Required tool:** `osv-scanner` (`brew install osv-scanner`) — used for live CVE scanning. `aiden doctor` shells out to it.

---

## MCP Servers

### Figma MCP

When implementing designs from the Figma MCP server:

- **Use localhost asset sources directly** — if the Figma MCP returns a `localhost` URL for an image or SVG, use that source as-is in `<img src>` or inline SVG; never replace it with a placeholder
- **Do NOT add icon packages** — all icons and graphic assets are delivered in the Figma payload; do not install or import additional icon libraries (e.g. `react-icons`, `heroicons`) when implementing Figma designs
- **Do NOT use placeholders** — if a localhost asset source is provided, use it; a missing asset is a bug to fix, not a reason to invent a substitute

> **Note on Lucide icons:** The "Lucide icons only" rule applies to net-new UI work not driven by a Figma spec. When implementing a Figma design, use the assets the Figma MCP provides.

---

## IMPORTANT: Library Versions & Documentation Lookup

**Before writing code that uses any external library, YOU MUST use the Context7 MCP to look up the latest documentation.** Do NOT rely on training data for SDK/library APIs — they go stale.

How: Use `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs` to fetch current API signatures and usage patterns.

This applies to: AI/LLM SDKs, Prisma, NextAuth, Stripe, SendGrid, and any third-party package — **except** the `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` packages, where the source of truth is each package's README in `node_modules/@upstart13-com/aiden-*/README.md`.

### Known SDK corrections

| Library      | CORRECT import                                      | WRONG (deprecated)                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google GenAI | `import { GoogleGenAI, Type } from "@google/genai"` | ~~`import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai"`~~ |

### Version Constraints

| Package | Allowed versions | Rule                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `axios` | `< 1.14.1`       | **NEVER install axios >= 1.14.1.** Pin to `1.14.0` or lower. If `package.json` has a range that could resolve to 1.14.1+, narrow it (e.g. `"axios": ">=1.12.0 <1.14.1"`). |

---

## AIDEN-specific gotchas

- **Schema changes go in fragments**, not in `prisma/schema.prisma` directly. Add a file to `prisma/fragments/<feature>.prisma`, then `npm run prisma:merge`. The composed `schema.prisma` is regenerated and should not be hand-edited.
- **`@upstart13-com/aiden-db` ships `Account`/`Session`/`VerificationToken`** for NextAuth — your `User` model must declare `accounts Account[]` and `sessions Session[]` relations.
- **Generated Prisma client** lives at `src/generated/prisma/` (Prisma 7 consumer-output). Gitignored. Do not edit.
- **Provider SDKs are optional peer deps** of `@upstart13-com/aiden-ai` — install only the ones you use (`npm install openai`, `npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk`, `npm install @google/genai`, etc).
- **`aiden.config.ts` is the feature-flag source.** `aiden doctor` reads it to know which env vars are required; `aiden upgrade` reads it to decide which codemods apply.
- **Upgrading the SDK**: never hand-edit `package.json` to bump `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` versions. Always run `npx aiden upgrade` so codemods + migrations run.

---

## Things to Avoid

- Writing UI code without reading the design system and invoking the `frontend-design` skill
- Hardcoded colors — always use CSS variable tokens
- Border radius beyond `rounded-2xl` (16px) — outside the Smithers DS scale
- Adding features or refactoring beyond what was requested
- Importing Prisma client in browser code — Prisma runs server-side only
- Using deprecated/outdated library imports without checking Context7 first
- Swallowing unexpected errors silently in `catch` blocks — always log via `log.error()` before returning
- Writing UI fetch calls without reading the API route first (mismatched response shapes silently produce empty data — see `.claude/fixes/ui.md`)
- Installing or upgrading `axios` to version 1.14.1 or greater — pin to `< 1.14.1`
- Creating API routes without `withAuth` (or explicit `auth()`) — every route must authenticate
- Database queries without `userId` scoping — IDOR risk; use `assertOwnership`
- Using `$executeRawUnsafe`, `eval()`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Importing server-only modules in `"use client"` components
- Hardcoding secrets or API keys — use environment variables
- Hand-editing `prisma/schema.prisma` instead of `prisma/fragments/*.prisma`
- Hand-editing `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` versions in `package.json` — use `npx aiden upgrade`
- Replacing an `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` primitive with a local reimplementation or a third-party library for an SDK concern (auth, security, database, logging, AI, UI) — use/extend the package and raise gaps upstream instead
- Skipping `/security-review` before creating a PR — enforced via `/ship`

| Any PR creation         | Run `/security-review` (enforced by `/ship`)                                     |

---

## Post-Task Validation

After completing any implementation task:

- Run `npm run lint` — fix all errors before considering a task done
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — confirm no type errors
- For API routes, auth, or payment changes: run `/security-review` to check for vulnerabilities

---

## Git Workflow

- Branch names: `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `docs/description`, `refactor/description`
- Conventional commits: `feat(auth): add google oauth`, `fix(stripe): correct webhook handler`
- Do NOT commit: `.env`, `.env.local`, `dist/`, `.next/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, `src/generated/`
- Use `/ship` to commit + push + open a PR — it runs `/security-review` first as a gate
- To upgrade the SDK: `npx aiden upgrade` opens a dedicated PR with all codemod + migration changes; review and merge that PR separately from feature work

---

## Collaboration Over Compliance

Push back when something is wrong, unclear, or could be done better. This is a team — not a chain of command. If a plan has a flaw, a decision doesn't make sense, or there's a better approach, say so before executing. Don't implement something just because it was asked for; understand why it's being asked for and challenge the premise if needed. The goal is the right outcome, not agreement.

---

## Keep Implementations Small

Every implementation should be as small as possible — meaning: build exactly what was planned, nothing more. Do not anticipate future needs, add conveniences that weren't asked for, or expand scope because it "seems useful." Understand the full picture first (read the plan, the design system, the existing code), then implement only the specific slice that was approved. If something feels like it should also be added, raise it as a separate conversation rather than including it silently. Small, deliberate, verified steps over fast, broad, untested ones.

---

## Implementation Documentation

After completing any implementation, write a documentation file explaining it in detail under `docs/project-documentation/`. The file name should reflect the feature or module (e.g., `docs/project-documentation/rbac.md`, `docs/project-documentation/query-engine.md`). The doc must cover: what was built, why key decisions were made, how the pieces fit together, any caveats or gotchas, and how to extend it. This is required — not optional.

---

## Progress Tracking

After completing any task, append a one-line entry to `.claude/progress.log`:

- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] STATUS type(scope): description — outcome`
- STATUS values: `completed`, `failed`, `blocked`, `discovered`
- This file is append-only. Never edit or truncate existing entries.

---

## Context Management

- Only read design system files relevant to the current task — do not read all 9 files at once
- Only read fix files relevant to the current task type
- For `@upstart13-com/aiden-*` API questions: read the relevant package README in `node_modules/@upstart13-com/aiden-*/`
- When context grows large, summarize findings rather than re-reading source files

---

## Lessons Learned

When you encounter a bug that took multiple attempts to fix, a non-obvious framework gotcha, or a configuration issue, record it in `.claude/fixes/<category>.md`. Create fix files as needed. Update `.claude/fixes/INDEX.md` as the aggregated index.
